/* HowTo.txt */ 

 build the toolset for the BeagleBoneBlack.

1) The toolset consists of the 2 major parts: binutils and gcc.

2) They are installed at the following directory: /opt/BeagleBoneBlack.

3) First you have to download binutils-2.25.1 and gcc-5.2.0 source packages. 
Assume you placed them in the directory Downloads and unpack. You have two directories
Downloads/binutils-2.25.1 and Downloads/gcc-5.2.0-cross. To build create the directories
Downloads/Build, Downloads/Build/binutils-2.25.1 and Downloads/Build/gcc-5.2.0-cross

4) Create the directory /opt/BeagleBoneBlack and copy the sysroot there.

5) First, build the binutils. Patch the source as desribed in the binutils-2.25.1/HowTo.txt.
You have to replace 2 files.
Then go to the build directory (Downloads/Build/binutils-2.25.1). Copy there the file binutils-2.25.1/MakeCfg.
Then configure the build by the command "make -f MakeCfg". Then do build by the command "make" and 
install the product by the command "make install".

6) Second, build the gcc. Patch the source as described in the gcc-5.2.0-cross/HowTo.txt.
You have to replace 4 files and edit manually the configuration script.
Then go to the build directory (Downloads/Build/gcc-5.2.0-cross). Copy there the file gcc-5.2.0-cross/MakeCfg.
Then configure the build by the command "make -f MakeCfg". Then do build by the command "make" and 
install the product by the command "make install". gcc have some requirements, so make sure your cygwin64 
installation includes them.

7) Finally, build the libraries in /opt/BeagleBoneBlack/sysroot. 
Go to the directory CCORE_ROOT/Target/BeagleBoneBlack/sysroot and use the command "make". 
Then copy files from the directory lib to /opt/BeagleBoneBlack/sysroot/lib.
